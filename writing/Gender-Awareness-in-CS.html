<p><em>By Xiaoni Lai (Olivia) 4 Nov 2003</em></p>
<p>Today I attended another class for the course "Graduate Research Seminars". It was about the topic of "Gender Sensitivity in STEM<sub>1</sub>". The talk was conducted by a lady who serves as gender culture advisor in U of Waterloo.</p>
<p>It seemed to be a popular topic in the Western world about how women are under-represented in the STEM field. Advocates of gender equity showcased the statistics to people to show this fact. In the area of Computer Science, very few women choose CS to be their undergraduate major; even if they do so, they might leave CS to pursue careers in other realms after they graduate. Similarly, not many women pursue Computer Science in graduate schools; even if they do so, they are less likely to pursue a PhD in CS; even if they pursue a PhD, they are more likely to drop out, or simply leave the academic field after graduation.</p>
<p>The society as a whole steretypes women to be associated with "child-raising motherhood". Even sometimes the role of career women does appear in television shows, they are mostly working on finance or humanities jobs. When someone mentions "programmer" or "computer scientist", what naturally visualizes in their mind is mostly a male figure instead of a female one. I subscribed to a few programmers' comics news feed in Facebook, and in whatever jokes they've made about programmers, the avatar in the comics is generally a young man.</p>
<p>One useful thing I've gained from this kind of gender talks is that they recognize how a woman pursuing Computer Science feels marginalized in such a cultural settings, especially when she is the only girl in the CS class, or she is the only girl working in the IT team. I felt so when I was working in my pervious company. My teammates tend to assign me jobs that are related to tedious data entry, instead of jobs that are exciting and involving heavy programming tasks. In my team and even in my neighbouring teams, I don't see any female employees working on intensive programming jobs. A typical good programmer in Credit Suisse IT section is perceived to be a 30-year-old man from India. And I had either to accept the social role the team assigned to me--being a cute girl organizing social events and decorations for a development team of all men and doing some secretary tasks during team meeting, or simply leave the team at all.</p>
<p>Such kind of gender talks should be held more frequently in China or Singapore. Not many people want to confront such a situation in Asia. Perhaps in China the gender equity issue was even worse, as people implicitly recognized women to be the inferior gender and no one dared to question this mindset. I've heard tons of stories of how young career women in China get discourged if they dare to step into male-dominated field. These women would be called as "female strong men", which is a pharse with derogatory sense.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think such campaign goes a little bit too far in North Amercia. Here, anyone who dare to publicly mock at women's ability in STEM would be criticized. And the law enforced that employers not to discriminate against women if the job could be well handled by women as well. In this case, is constant reminder of gender issue a good thing for girls in Computer Science? I don't think so.</p>
<p>For me, when I was working on a tough CS question, I normally didn't perceive myself to be a women uncapable of handling the task. In fact, I wouldn't think of my gender at all! And such attitude helps me because deep down in my heart I know that I'm not anyway different than other male students. So I'm neither superior nor inferior to them. If I was constantly reminded that "I am a woman" and "women are under-represented in STEM", I think I would become more aware of my gender when I'm working on CS questions. These would negatively affect my attitude, because I would start to justify my incapability of solving that question with my gender. </p>
<p>I should post my last point in a forum to see if any other women have the same thoughts as me.</p>
