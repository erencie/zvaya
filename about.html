						<h1>Childhood</h1>
					</div>
					<h3>Small City, Small Girl</h3>
						<p>I was born in a small city called Shantou (or known as Swatow) on the eastern coast of southern China. In history it was significant as one of the treaty ports established for Western trade and contact, and as one of the original Special Economic Zones of China established in the 1980s. But in my memory, it was a quiet and warm city, in where I had stayed for the first 15 years
						in my life. I speak Teochew, which is a local dialect in metropolitan region including Shantou and its immediately surrounding cities.</p>
						<p>My family is an ordinary yet harmonious one. My father likes to address himself as a &#34;small entrepreneur&#34;. He set up a small-scaled manufacturing factory in mid-1980s to make an earning for the whole family, despite that he only holds a high school diploma. In leisure, he likes to read a lot of self-improvement books. The bookshelf at home is always stacked with books like &#34;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&#34; or &#34;Chicken Soup Life Lessons&#34;. My mother is an ordinary housewife, whose education level barely
						enables her to read newspaper--which is already quite a sufficient life skill for women in that era. She has very nice temperament and lots of old-school wisdoms. I also have my grandma who has a strong character. Her belief in Buddhism also influenced me a lot. Moreover, I have a younger brother who grew up with me together.</p>
						<p>Unlike many Chinese parents, my parents never pushed me for my studies. Since young, I was studying under no pressures from my parents. Nobody would scold me if I did not do my homeworks immediately after returning home. However, every night when clock stroke 10pm, my father would force me to go to sleep, even if homeworks were incomplete. He always said, &#34;sufficient sleep is the most important thing.&#34;So, I learnt that I need to be highly concentrated and efficient in making my homeworks done before 10pm, or else getting embarrassement in next day's class when teacher asks for them.</p>
					<h3>Reading, Reading, Reading</h3>
						<p>Under the influence of my father, I like reading books since young. In the beginning, I only read those written for children, such as fairy tale and legends from different cultures in the world. In late primary school, I start to read Romance books and write poems on my own. One of my poems was posted in the blackboard at the entrance of my school. Nowadays when I look back those poems I've written in that period, they were immature, yet interesting.</p>
						<p>I attended a secondary school near my home for my junior secondary education (equivalent to Grade 7-9 in American system). I believe that this is the most carefree period in my life. I eagerly learnt new knowledge from school, made new friends, and enjoyed my early teenage years. In primary school we only have three core courses: Chinese, Mathematics and English. But here we had more interesting courses. I started to learn History, Geography, Psychology (which turned out to become a politics course in later years of secondary school), Biology, Physics, Chemistry in addition with the three core courses mentioned above.</p>
						<p>In fact, during that time I couldn't really understand why some other children hates to study. For me, I enjoyed the time when I could learn something wonderful. Great civilizations in the history. The vastness and diversity of the Earth in Geography. The intricate chemical and biological processes in all organisms. These were all appealing to a young girl like me. Such interest drove me to do well in school and the positive feedbacks from teachers in turn made my interest stronger.</p>
					<h3>Physics</h3>
						<p>At some point of time, I started to have an interest in Physics. Most probably, it was because I read too many science fictions in early secondary school years. When I was a bit bored with the typical plot in many romance novels, I started to look for some other interesting ones. The genre of science fiction attracted me. There were many of them which used hard core contemporary physics as the base of their stories. In order to understand these stories better, I looked for books which could help me understand those Physics theorems.
						</p>
						<p>Obviously this had some positive effects on my school works. I kept scoring first in my Physics class. Although exams did not really indicate anything, it was a really proud thing for a young teenager to keep scoring first in Physics. My Physics teacher was an old man who was very dedicated in teaching. He never praised me in the class. Instead, he kept telling me not to be arrogant because Physics is very profound subject that requires many efforts and time to truly understand it better. </p>
						<p>When there was a Physics National Competition coming around, he nominated me to participate. The training was also conducted by him. I was quite fortunate to be taught in such an intensive Physics training by a good teacher. After some months of training, I took part in the national competition. I could roughly remembered that I could answer most of the questions.</p>
						<p>The result came out and I had won the First Prize. I was also the top in my city. For quite a long time in my life, this prize made me feel that I was good in Physics and I should keep learning it. But that feeling started to fade when I came to Singapore later on. Sometimes, I would think that if I continued to stay in China for my upper secondary school, I might keep it on and end up becoming a Physicist somewhere in the world. But that was just a childhood fantasy.</p>
					<h3>End of Junior Secondary School</h3>
						<p>After the high school entrance exams, I got into the best high school-- Jinshan High School -- in my city. I was almost ready to start my new semester there. However, in that summer holidays, a call from my teacher changed my life path. The teacher nominated me to go for an interview held by some people from the Ministry of Education in Singapore.</p>
						<p>It was a one-day test, including IQ test, Mathematics, English and an interview. On that night, I was informed by a call that I was offered a full scholarship to study in a high school in Singapore. Everything was so quick and I realized that I now had to leave my hometown for a different country. I was fifteen then.

						<h1>Coming to Singapore</h1>
					</div>
					<h3>Join The Local Students</h3>
					<p>The first three months in Singapore were all about excitement and happiness. I stayed in Dunman High Hostel, a place for pre-university international students, and met other scholars from China or ASEAN countries. I attended English classes in Tanjong Pagar Girls' School. The English training period is a very relaxed time, especially for someone who just left the intensive high school entrance exams in China. I brought an electronic translator everywhere I went and checked up meanings of the English words appearing on the roadside advertisement or announcements. I knew that I looked funny in the eyes of locals, but that was the fastest way to quickly pick up vocabularies used in everyday contexts.</p>
					<p>After the happy English trainig period, I came to Temasek Secondary School and joined the study with the Secondary Three students here. I remembered the first day of school. I came to sit on the front row in classroom early and tried to talk to a local girl using my not-yet-polished English. However, I was not very lucky. The girl I randomly chose to start my conversation is not that kind of nice girl who likes to welcome newcomers. She was impatient with my slow talking pace and inaccurate pronunciations, and replied me briefly in a desultory tone. She also did not smile at all. These made me feel quite awkward and uncomfortable, so I stopped the conversation. It was so discouraging. </p>
					<p>But it took me not so long to meet some other nice students in the class. I soon had some friends from Hong Kong and Taiwan (interestingly, all were not locals). Although I did interacted well with local students, sometimes I found it hard to have deeper communication with them. I think a possible explanation for this would be that most local students were staying with their parents at that age and thus did not really comprehend an independent lifestyle led by many foreign students here. For example, they liked to talk about their daily conflicts with parents or siblings at home, while I could only contact my families via weekly international call.</p>
					<p>In the two years in Temasek, I studied many subjects instructed in English: Combined Humanities (Social Studies + Human Geography), two subjects in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and the most scary English subject. Interestingly, I also studied two subjects in  Chinese here -- one of them is Chinese literature, which I never systematically studied before. Unlike other foreign scholars here, much of my time was spent in conquering the English subject. It required students to write two essays and answer comprehension questions for a given passage. Two years later, I attended the GCE O-Level exams and obtained straight A1's in all the subjects except English -- which was a satisfactory grade of B3 for me as well.</p>
					<p>Besides the academic achievements, I also joined the Chinese Orchestra in my school and learnt to play percussion instruments there. The time in Temasek was fruitful to me, as I learnt new things in new language and made new friends. But it was also stressful and sometimes even depressing for me, especially when I felt lonely and scared as a child who was so far away from home. But I grew up as a more mature and independent individual as well. No pain, no gain. Isn't it true?</p>

					<h3>Competition Everywhere</h3>
					<p>I later went to Hwa Chong Institution -- one of the best junior colleges here. My pride of having straight A1's in my O-Level did not last long here, because I soon discovered that there were many other students here who also scored extraordinarily well in O-Level. The only memory about Hwa Chong left in my mind is all about stress and competition. Think of the fact that every year there were a bunch of Hwa Chong graduates heading to world-renowned universities, such as Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Cambridge, and so on so forth. Also think of the fact that every year 80% of all Hwa Chong students scored A in GCE A-Level Biology/Chemistry. Well, you know what I mean. In this school, the internal Mid-Year exams were not called  &#34;Mid-Year Exams&#34;; instead, they were called as  &#34;Block Exams &#34; because they were supposed to  &#34;block &#34; students. Unfortunately I was one of those who were  &#34;blocked &#34;, as I played too much in the first few months because Hwa Chong offered a lot of activities for students to show their skills. But more probably, the exams were set to be extremely difficult that even straight A1's students couldn't pass them easily. And surprisingly, no matter how difficult the exams were, there were always some smart people who scored above 80 out of 100. And some of these smart people were also foreign scholars as me. So imgaine the pressure I had when teachers tried to categorize me in the group with them. Anyway, these very smart people all went to Ivy League schools after graduation, with all kinds of honor awards and abundant undergraduate scholarships.</p>
					<p>In fact, I also applied the Physics major in some colleges in US and UK. But the application process, including taking all sorts of SAT exams, was messed up with my preparation to the school preliminary exams and GCE A-Level exams. In the end, I missed application deadlines of a few colleges. Some good schools did give me offers without scholarships, which were same as rejection letters for me. The A-Level exam result was also not very satisfactory. But luckily I still got very good grade in General Paper (we called it  &#34;English &#34; subject). After all, this application process was a journey of self-discovery and exploration. After it, I gradually discovered that it might not work well for me to pursue Physics. Being good at it and being extraordinarily good at it are two different things. My advantage in this subject over other peers had gradually faded away when I diverted my energy to too many things since I came to Singapore. I need to look for some other directions, preferably still in maths/science region as I think I am still good at it.</p>

					<h3>This Is Our Own Association</h3>
					<p>Before I came to Singapore, I already knew the <strong>Singapore Teochew Students Association</strong> here, because one of my seniors was my father's friend's son. He came here four years earlier than me in the same way and established this association with other students. The purpose is simply to unite all students studying in Singapore from my city (as well as some neighboring cities) in China. It was established as a subsidiary under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_Poit_Ip_Huay_Kuan">Singapore Teochew Poit Ip Huay Kuan</a>. The association is the first contact point in Singapore for many new students from my city, including me.</p>
					<p>The association has a board of committee members. This group of about ten people decides what the association head for and organizes events for people. When I was in Hwa Chong Institution, people thought that I already had some seniority in Singapore education system and that I could help other younger students. Moreover, my Chinese writing skills was considered to be quite good among Chinese students. Based on that, I was nominated into the third batch of committee and given a title of &#34;head of publication&#34;.</p>
					<p>Undoubtedly there were many jobs as a head of publication, such as organizing some social events or editing the latest magazines for the association. But the most challenging one for me then was the website. This was actually not compulsory for me. But I thought that having a good website would be good for the future growth of association. So I volunteered to create one by myself--this sounded brave as a person without any sorts of computing background. At that time, there was a senior committee member who promised that he could help me. But later he reneged, perhaps because he was too busy preparing his university applications and A-Level.</p>
					<p>During that period of time, I went to the national library in Takashimaya at Orchard Road after school three times a week, and read the resources teaching people how to create websites. This looks silly in my eyes now; but at that time it was natural for me: Google search was not yet popular and moreover, I hadn't had the experience of doing self-learning on computing-related things from the Internet. I remembered the first book I read was one of the For Dummies book series.</p>
					<p>Instead of relying on facy applications such as Dreamweaver, I used Notepad to write webpages. Many years later, I learnt that <strong>learning to code in a text editor makes for a better programmer, because it makes one actually learn how the language works</strong>. But at that time I did not have this idea. I was simply thinking that since I was a computing noob, I'd better use simple tools to create simple things. Yet Dreamweaver auto-generated many codes which I didn't quite understand.</p>
					<p>I showcased my first website to one older friend, who was well known for his programming skills within our social circle. He said, &#34;You typed all these tags and scripts using Notepad? That's amazing!&#34; He commented that I had the potential of learning programming because I seemed to be unafraid of trying all these new things on my own--which is quite an essential quality for good programmers.</p>
					<p>Perhaps the expericne boosted my confidence in working with computers. And it particularly helped me when it came to the time of deciding college major.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>JC3 Period</h3>
					<p>After I've done with my A-Level exams, I had about eight months of free time before university life began. We call this period 'JC3 Period' because it is an extension of JC2 (Junior College second year). During this long period of time, I waited for the outcome of my applications to US/UK universities and A-Level exams. But the outcomes were not so good. I was just a high school graduate from a middle-income family and I couldn't afford the expensive tuition fees in most US/UK colleges. However, in Singapore I could receive loan from local bank to afford my tuition fees here. Due to financial considerations, I decided to go to NUS. After all, it is quite a great university.</p>
					<p>What else did I do in the rest of time during that period? I travelled, played, read many books, learnt playing guitars, and earned money by doing part-time jobs. The thing which I believe worth mentioning would be my part-time jobs.</p>
					<p>One of my part-time jobs was teaching kids Mathematics and Chinese. At first, I taught two Singaporean Chinese kids as a <strong>home tutor</strong>. One was a naughty boy who was clever and yet not attentive to his studies. The other one was a fat boy who seemed to have certain difficulties with his studies, despite his efforts. After some observations on their characteristics, I tried to use different approaches in teaching these two kids. For the naughty boy, I tried to come up with challenging and yet interesting quizzes which could catch his attentions. I also prepared some extra readings for him. He quickly picked up the learning materials and had improvements on his studies. For the other boy, it was a bit difficult. I notied that he had difficulties in understanding very simple concepts no matter how many tiems I explained. In fact, I was not a very patient person then; but in front of him, I tried to make myself more patient because I knew that if I showed my impatience to him, he might lose confidence in himself and things would become worse. After several tuition sessions, I gradually understood the way he understands things and adapted my explanations to his way. For example, he seemed to remember words which were matched to some particular pictures. So I always drew a cartoon when I explained a new concept to him. This drawing definitely was time-consuming and I normally wouldn't use it on other children. But he seemed to like this method quite well.</p>
					<p>I also taught an Indian boy for only one time. The reason why I only went there for one time was that the Indian child's mother insisted that she wanted a university graduate to teach her son who was in his Primary Four. She was very unsatisfied when I told her that I only held a high school diploma. The kid was quite smart. I tested him some Olympiad Math problems and he responded quickly, though not quite accurately. He seemed to be under great pressure in living up to his mother's high expectations on him. His mother was asking for university graduates to teach him Primay Six Olympiad Mathematics.</p>
					<p>Besides doing home tuition, I also served as a <strong>waitress in a seafood restaurant</strong>. Despite the pay of merely five dollars per hour, the boss expected his workers to keep busy in serving customers. I was asked to constantly deliver the plates with food ready to the customers' tables. Sometimes, it might be steamboat fish: the soup was boiling hot and the fire was burning fiercely underneath the plate. In the beginning, my fingers were sometimes burnt by the fire or scalded by the hot soup. Later, I learnt to be careful in protecting myself while delivering the food.</p>
					<p>It was a good time for me to <strong>experience the life of poor poeple in the society</strong>. During the time when I worked there, I interacted with many other full-time waiters and plate washers there. Most of them did not receive education beyond junior secondary schools. The relied on one or two low-end jobs with salaries much lower than the national average level. Some of them were foreigners; they worked there to accumulate some money for their poor families in their home countries. Some were local Singaporeans who were old and did not have adult children to financially support their daily expenses. They worked hard just to earn some meager salaries to sustain the most basic expenses, such as food. I saw them saving every possible cent in order to buy a better dress, or to get into a better meal in a relatively better restaurant.</p>
					<p>This was quite a shock to me. Although as a student then, I was also quite thrift in my daily expenses. But I still arbitrarily bought books, snacks and girls' accessories. Moreover, I had a bright future because I knew that when I graduated from university, I could also become one of the middle-class adults. The lives of these poor people were totally different. Most of them were middle-aged or older. They could only continue such lives without little possibilities of changes.</p>
					<p>This made me became aware of how lucky I was, as an inspiring young student who could have a bright future. <strong>I learnt to treasure what I had</strong>. This also taught me that life is never easy and I should never complain too much if I encounter any difficulties, because there are many people who are much more unfortunate than me.</p>

					<h3>Computer Science, Really?</h3>
					<p>There were quite some reasons why I picked CS as a major. Having my physics dream beaten up by the reality was one reason. The persuasion from my friend (the one whom I showcased my first website) to go to School of Computing was another reason. But more importantly, I had a sense of instinct that programming might be quite fun. And indeed it is.</p>
					<p> (In my personal statement to graduate schools, I still included my initial interst in Physics although some non-science-stream friends suggested that this is kind of irrelevant. I noted that Edsger W. Dijkstra also studied theoretical Physics in undergraduate studies and later became the pioneer of Computer Science.)</p>
					<p>In the 8-month JC3 period, I borrowed a textbook teaching Scheme programming language from NUS libray using the student card from my senior. I read through the whole book and wrote down the errors I found onto a piece of paper, which I later inserted in the book when I returned the book to library. This is the first programming language I've learnt.</p>
					<p>On top of that, I read some other books and came to understand that Computer Science is not simply programming. It involves intensive mathematical thinking and logic reasoning. It is neight a study of computer machine such as hard disk, monitors or processors. I came to know a folkloric quotation which is well known in the computing community: Computer Science is no more about computers than Astronomy is about telescopes. This saying struck me because I am an amateur astronomy lovers and I know how telescopes are used in astronomy study.</p>
					<p>With this concept in mind, I began my university life. There were too much to say about my undergraduate life, especially the experience of learning Computer Science. So I put it as one independent section in <a href="university.html">this webpage</a>.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Trial And Error</h3>
					<p>In the beginning of university studies, I planned to take Economics as a minor. I took one introductory course in Year One and subsequently Macroeconomics in Year Two. Then I took Microeconomics in Year Three when I went to an exchange programme in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne. Sadlyh, I couldn't complete the Minor requirement of six Economics modules.</p>
					<p>The reason why I couldn't complete this minor was definitely not because I was incapable in studying Economics or anything: in fact, I think Economics courses were quite easy, at least for those junior-level ones.</p>
